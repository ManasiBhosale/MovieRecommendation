# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on user preferences and viewing history. Built with Flask, it provides an interactive web interface for users to receive personalized movie recommendations.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: Users can input their watched movies to receive tailored recommendations.
- **Data-Driven Suggestions**: Utilizes the MovieLens dataset to generate accurate recommendations.
- **Web Interface**: A simple and intuitive web interface built with Flask.
- **Recommendation Flexibility**: Users can choose movies based on genre or year.

## Dataset

The system employs a small subset of the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset, which includes:

- **Ratings Data**: User ratings for various movies.
- **Movies Data**: Details about movies such as titles and genres.

Only a small part of the MovieLens dataset was selected for this project, rather than using the entire dataset, to optimize performance and focus on relevant movie recommendations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManasiBhosale/MovieRecommendation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd MovieRecommendation
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Dataset**:

   Place the MovieLens dataset files (`ratings.csv`, `movies.csv`, etc.) into the `data` directory.

## Usage

1. **Start the Flask Application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface**:

   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. **Get Recommendations**:

   - Choose movies based on **year** or **genre**.
   - Select movies you have already watched to improve recommendation accuracy.
   - Receive personalized movie suggestions based on similar users' ratings.

## Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: Main Flask application file.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing the dataset files.
- **`scripts/`**: Contains scripts for data processing and recommendation algorithms.
- **`templates/`**: HTML templates for the web interface.
- **`static/styles/`**: CSS stylesheets for the web interface.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python dependencies.
